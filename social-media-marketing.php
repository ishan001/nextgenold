                                            Social media has become a veritable science that has served to help businesses glean a great deal of awareness, and revenue via the online sphere. Social Media Marketing (SMM) is the art of drawing in as many fans, and interacting with them via various social mediums.

                                        <p>
                                            While Facebook alone has over a billion profiles, there are many other social mediums that have made their stake. If you're a business owner, it is prudent for you to carve out your own niche within this online social marketplace.

                                            Here are some interesting stats. As per the 2013 State of Digital Marketing report Webmarketing123, 54 percent of B2B marketers and 60 percent of B2C marketers, who were surveyed, stated that they've generated leads from social media.

                                            Just like traditional marketing, your business requires a plan and strategy. One of the many mistakes businesses make is being present in every social medium. This, in fact, is a waste of time. For example, LinkedIn is perfect for B2B, while Facebook Fan Pages are brilliant for B2C; Twitter and Pinterest would be ideal for creating brand awareness etc.
